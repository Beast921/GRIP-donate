        <div>
          <p>
            We work in the hardest-to-reach places, where it's toughest to be a
            child.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout India, we have transformed the lives of thousands of
            orphaned, abandoned, and trafficked girls.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have rescued girls from the horrors of the street. In our care,
            they are loved, fed nutritious food, they go to school. They are
            able to regain their childhood as well as prepare themselves for the
            future. Girls who once came to us in ragged clothes and sadness in
            their souls are now nurses and office workers, fashion designers and
            computer programmers. They have broken the cycle of poverty.

      <div class="about">
        <div>
          <p>
            We believe all children need a functional and committed parental
            structure in order to thrive. The primary beneficiary of our work
            must be a child who has a substantial absence of parental
            involvement, support and input in their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            We work all over the country, doing whatever it takes — every day
            and in times of crisis — to give children a healthy start in life,
            the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are committed to the orphan – we are parents to the parentless
            and we don’t leave them. If things don’t go exactly to plan, we find
            another way of helping and protecting them. They can’t be left
            vulnerable again.
